# Quiz-App-2

QUIZ APP

The most popular quiz app has become very expensive... so there came a startup that aspires to build a new one that will be better, cheaper to use and more fun! You join the startup as a developer and your task is to build a nice prototype of the product while the rest of the product team works to define what the final version will be.

Weekly specs:

JS2 week1 - Browser environment, DOM manipulation, DOM event listeners

 create a form to insert a quiz question. It should take a question and 4 options for answers. There should be a way to mark which answer is correct in the form, but you should only be able to select one correct answer.

b. color the input for the "correct" answer option in green and the "wrong" ones in red. Make sure it's still readable.


week 2: Array functions, Arrow function

Start with creating an array of quiz question objects. Even a small one is perfectly enough, but go as big as you want! Continue with the format of the question object you used last week or improve it and refactor!

 save the quiz question into an array when the form is submitted.

 show a list of all quiz questions added to the array below the form. It should show the questions, the 4 options but not which one is correct. Add a button with the functionality to reveal which is the correct answer for each question.

 build a function to filter the questions by searching the content of the question.

JS2 week3 - Callback function, Asynchronicity, Scope

 add inputs for 2 player names and a button to start a quiz. When the quiz starts, player names are displayed with their collected points (0 to begin with).


b. add number inputs for the player points and use the browser's arrow buttons on the input fields to increase/decrease the points.

JS3 week1 - Json, Apis, Fetch

 refactor your code so that you ditch the static array of objects and instead fetch the initial questions data from an API.

 ensure all the functionality is working smoothly after refactoring.

 add alphabetical sorting of the questions and random sorting of the questions and let the user choose.

JS3 week2 - Promises, Async/Await


 add a search input to filter the questions by searching the content of the question - use the function that you have build before. When you click the search button, display only the questions where the search input is included in the question text.
